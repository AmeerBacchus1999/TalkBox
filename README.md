# TalkBox
In this release, a runnable jar file, that is both the configurator and the simulator of a TalkBox device, was developed. In this application, the user can indicate the number of audio buttons, swap buttons and audio sets they want to configure to their TalkBox device. The user will be able to configure the audio buttons of the different audio sets by dragging and dropping audio and picture files from their computer to the audio buttons and they can also record new audio files using the record button from the Welcome window, which can also be added to the audio buttons. The user can launch the simulator to see the configured audio buttons and swap buttons. The user can also save the configurations as profiles, which be can loaded and viewed in the configuration app. The user will also be able to view logging information from the Welcome window.
